# Knapsack-Problem-Genetic-Algorithm

About the problem:
The knapsack problem is a very well-known optimization problem. Given a knapsack that can carry weights up to a certain amount, and a number of items; each item has a weight and a value, we want to select the items to carry in the knapsack in order to maximize the total value.

What you are required to do:
Write a genetic algorithm to solve the knapsack
problem. (A solved example is provided in lab 1)


Important remarks to help you solve the problem:
1. Use a binary, one-dimensional chromosome.
2. The population size and initialization method you use are up to you. You can actually try different population sizes to see how this will affect your results. The maximum number of generations is also up to you.
3. Think about how you will handle infeasible solutions. Infeasible solutions are solutions that violate the constraints of the problem; therefore, they are not allowed.
4. Use rank selection and one-point crossover. Choose the methods of mutation and replacement that you find appropriate.
5. The output should consist of the test case index, the number of selected items, the total value, and the weight and value of each selected item.
