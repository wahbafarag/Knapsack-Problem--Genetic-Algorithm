# Knapsack-Problem-Genetic-Algorithm

About the problem:
The knapsack problem is a very well-known optimization problem. Given a knapsack that can carry weights up to a certain amount, and a number of items; each item has a weight and a value, we want to select the items to carry in the knapsack in order to maximize the total value.

What you are required to do:
Write a genetic algorithm to solve the knapsack
problem. (A solved example is provided in lab 1)
